DialectAI is an AI-powered web tool designed to detect regional Telugu dialects (like Srikakulam, Nellore, East Godavari) from speech input and translate them into English. It bridges the gap in current translation tools by focusing on dialectal variations, making regional communication more accessible and inclusive.
